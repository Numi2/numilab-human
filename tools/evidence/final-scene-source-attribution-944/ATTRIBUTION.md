# Source attribution and limitations — native resting scene

This file accompanies the scene and movie from the 8 October 2026 native
preflight at final-native-scene-preflight-936/skin-927-current-lung-924/.
Keep it with copies of the scene folder, native-viewer.mov, and extracted
frames. It records upstream credits and limits; it does not grant rights beyond
the source licenses.

## Exact preflight identity

## Z-Anatomy source package

The source catalog declares Z-Anatomy repository revision
9a2ef22cc8443d14f9aa18ba91246416b1c6ab7a, bound to the archive and Blender
scene below. The raw export does not itself contain a Git revision field; the
revision is catalog-declared and linked by the matching archive/scene hashes.

The 924 anatomy receipt identifies Z-Anatomy-derived scene inputs as stable
IDs 305–311: five lung-lobe meshes (305–309), a pleura proxy (310), and
source-derived diaphragm geometry (311). Stable IDs 14–21 are inferred liver
exterior display patches whose names and FMA crosswalks use Z-Anatomy segment
guides; their rendered geometry is one closed aggregate shell, not eight
source segment meshes, internal Couinaud partitions, or independent segment
volumes. The selected Z-derived scene set does not include the separately credited cranial-nerve, inner-ear,
or kidney reference components from the upstream license. Its inner-ear and
kidney components carry additional non-commercial terms.

The pleura is an external lung-union proxy. It is not a parietal pleural layer,
interlobar lining, fluid domain, or pleural mechanics model. The lung meshes are
registered atlas envelopes, not parenchymal tissue, measured gas volume, or
clinical registration.

The historical stable-ID-22 row in the packed NHA payload is traced in retained
lineage to BodyParts3D member FJ2824 (source SHA-256
2f5e34fceea6c8b718bd3f50a125bf24c434ae7eb3d925b9795b0585272c1349). The
001 and 007 payloads preserve its 11,459 vertices, 21,592 faces, and exact face
topology; the later neutral-pose rebase carries it from body 7 to torso body 20
with unchanged face topology and a recorded selected-set maximum world-position
error of 1.60e-8 m. The 924 receipt intentionally retires ID 22 as an alias to
aggregate liver display patch 21 and excludes it from the active source-ID map.
The packed legacy row remains present; the retirement records that it is not a
separately identified liver segment or separately defined volume. This lineage
is an inferred registration/rebase, not a new source measurement.

## MyoSim articulated model

The active body and muscle model is based on MyoSim myofullbody, pinned at
commit 33c89c2bde282553dde3f526768eb3bdcfaa7649 from
https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_sim. The pinned upstream license is
https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_sim/blob/33c89c2bde282553dde3f526768eb3bdcfaa7649/LICENSE.
The retained source manifest identifies
the archive SHA-256 as
280d297aa496acccf3f1c5373a1304d23f9569362c2d6960910128bfba144975 and the
license as Apache-2.0. The source manifest also records local knee-coordinate
overlays; this preflight uses those compiled source-derived payloads.

MyoSim supplies articulated body/joint/muscle definitions and source tendon
sites. It is distinct from the anatomical surface providers listed above.
The local Human notices and manifests retain the Apache notice; model rights
remain bounded by upstream terms and any separately identified source models.

## Loaded scene payloads and inferred content

The invocation binds the following source-bearing payloads and scene supports:

It also loads the Numi-format reference-circulation configuration
resting_reference_lv15.native.v3.json (SHA-256
43ff6b49daf1d42cf9e88d85d8577f70e112dfcc3756ec43954e544a3e4bc0dc) and the
resting-reference-respiration.json file (SHA-256
c518926bf47fba945cef52bb952ed6c559d604508988082c5b641b720bda503d). These
parameter/configuration files are not 3D anatomy assets; their scientific
source lineage is recorded with the circulation reference and native study.

The NHSKIN correction changes referenced positions and regenerates their rest-world normals: its manifest reports the canonical
86 bindings, per-vertex influence records, weights, triangle indices, and
registration fingerprint preserved. The 0.25 mm directional target used by the
offline clearance solver is an engineering constraint, not a measured skin
thickness. Runtime bed support is a reduced 32-region point-witness method
whose selected support vertex is chosen from the complete skin at each step;
it is not a triangle-mesh collision simulation.

NHTISS4 provides passive inspection surfaces, not a force-transmitting tissue
continuum, calibrated constitutive law, or collision response. NHTENDON3
contains inferred attachment envelopes and point fallbacks; its endpoints are
not source-authored or measured human entheses. The reduced circulation model
owns chamber blood volumes and flow accounting; anatomical heart surfaces are
visual references rather than independent blood-volume compartments.

## Evidence boundary

The linked native-viewer.mov is from a 10,000-step, 2 ms (20 simulated second)
native integration preflight using the hashes above. It is not the separate
310-second paired study, a full breathing-cycle anatomy qualification, a
measured-person registration, or clinical validation. A later NHA/NHSKIN hash
change requires updating this source fingerprint block before reusing the
sidecar. Keep the upstream credits with any distributed derivative.
