# Human gap execution registry

The completion plan is now an executable inventory. Its 14 workstreams match
the [live ledger](HUMAN_COMPLETION_GAP_LEDGER.md), its 46 tasks name owners and
acceptance criteria, and its target links cover all 95 mandatory Human targets.
The dependency graph has ten layers and twelve initial independent tasks.
These are scheduling relationships; tasks are not assessed for readiness or
completion by this command.

```sh
numi human gap-execution
numi human gap-execution --output /private/tmp/human-gap-execution.json
numi human gap-execution \
  --coverage /path/to/current-target-coverage.json \
  --output /private/tmp/human-gap-execution-with-coverage.json
```

The [registry](../config/human-gap-execution.v1.json) stores engineering,
source-data, calibration, validation and performance tasks. It contains no
editable qualification status. The command quotes current ledger status,
remaining gaps and closure gates, hashes every referenced file and emits a
content hash for the report. A changed report cannot overwrite an existing
output path. The [schema](../schemas/human-gap-execution.v1.schema.json) rejects
extra fields; the compiler additionally rejects missing ledger rows or
mandatory targets, duplicate identities, unknown prerequisites, cycles and
missing or external repository references.

With `--coverage`, the existing target-coverage validator first admits the
manifest. Every mandatory target is bound to its current leaf hash. Additional
source leaves remain explicitly unmapped, and unresolved source registers
remain visible. An absent coverage input yields `not_assessed` source assignment;
an empty source inventory does not imply complete source coverage. The command
does not validate the scientific evidence referenced by the ledger, lower a
runtime package, or change integrated qualification from `not_assessed`.

The first engineering streams are candidate/accepted-position precision
and accepted-root behavioral telemetry. The [bounded implementation](ACCEPTED_STATE_PRECISION_20260913.md)
repairs the retained 25 µs failure and adds a real joint-publication metric
producer; both tasks retain their full acceptance gates below. Anatomical
supports/loading, activation, spatial blood mass and momentum ownership,
unresolved material data and calibration have separate dependency tasks.
The registry retains the unchanged 100/50/25/12.5µs common-duration refinement
gate and frozen standing/recovery/walking protocols. Neither a shorter native
trajectory nor metadata coverage closes those gates.

Validation on 2026-09-13: twelve focused registry tests and fourteen existing
target-coverage tests pass. The JSON Schema passes Draft 2020-12 schema checking
and independently validates the shipped registry with `jsonschema` 4.25.1.
These checks cover inventory integrity and report behavior, with no new
anatomical, mechanical or behavioral qualification.
